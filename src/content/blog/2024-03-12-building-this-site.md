Having worked with a variety of web frameworks I'm used to building interactive sites primarily with Phoenix LiveView or ReactJS. These both have their downsides and I've found don't always meet my needs. I built this site in order to try out tools that are optimised for content, with a solid component system, and an easy way to get a reasonably well styled website up and running quickly.

There are A LOT of choices for static site generation, and ultimately many would meet my needs. The reasons I chose Astro were:

- Very quick to get started
- Lots of [themes](https://astro.build/themes/) available
- Easy integration with Tailwind
- Flexible - with straightforward support for HTML, markdown, JavaScript, and even support for using other frameworks like React, Svelte, etc.

I started the site based on the [Astroship theme](https://astro.build/themes/details/astroship/). It gives a pretty decent starting point, taking very little time to get started. It also introduced me to [Web3Forms](https://web3forms.com/) which is a nice low effort way to get a basic contact form on your site. I'd consider switching to [Mailchimp forms](https://mailchimp.com/features/custom-forms/) in the future, but Web3Forms took about 2 minutes to get working so I haven't switched over yet.

Overall it's a pretty good experience so far.
